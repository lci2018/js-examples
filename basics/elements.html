    <h1>JS Elements</h1>
    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
      Data is the information that use the scripts to work. The usual types are
      numerals (a numeric value), literals (a textual value, usually in
      quotation marks) and booleans (with a true or false value).
    </p>
    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>
      Variables are keywords which value can change. They can reference data
      thay may be unknown at a given moment, but will be interpreted and
      manipulated by our scripts.
    </p>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>
      Functions group several lines of code that can be executed at our will.
      They are declared with the word
      <code>function</code> followed by the function name and a pair of
      brackets, and the related group of code in curly brackets.
    </p>
    <h2>Conditionals</h2>
    <p>
      Conditionals execute a group of code only when certain conditions are met
      (for example, when a variable equals a specific value).
    </p>
    <h2>Loops</h2>
    <p>
      Loops repeat the execution of a group of code a specific number of times
      (for example, for each element of a given type, or when a specific
      condition is met).
    </p>
    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p>
      Objects are data models with properties (relation between a key and its
      value) and methods (internal functions). Almost everything in JavaScript
      are objects, like the window objects, the console object and even
      variables and functions and, as such, these objects have methods and
      properties that can be accessed.
    </p>
    <h2>Accessing the DOM</h2>
    <p>
      The DOM is the Document Object Model (how JavaScript interprets a
      website). Methods from this object, like
      <code>document.querySelector()</code>, are used to access and manipulate
      the HTML.
    </p>
    <h2>Events and listeners</h2>
    <p>
      Events are things that happen on a website, originated either by a user
      action (clicking, scrolling, pressing a key…) or by the browser itself
      (starting or finishing to load a page, exiting a page…).
    </p>
    <p>
      Listeners are methods that link a specific function with a specific event;
      for instance, when the action of clicking a button occurs, a function that
      shows some content is executed.
